# Car_Evaluation-using-RandomForest
Car Evaluation Database was derived from a simple hierarchical decision model 
originally developed for the demonstration of DEX, M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic.

We build a model using the Random forest algorithm. This model evaluates the class of cars using the following features : safety, lug_boot, number of persons, number of doors, maintenance cost, buying price.
